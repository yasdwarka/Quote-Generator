# Quote-Generator
Creating a random quotation generator
The objective will be both simple and fun: to will build a random quote generator, in which the quotes will be randomly constructed by assembling different pieces of a sentence.

The quotes are generated randomly one by one with each JavaScript call
Each quote is a combination of at least 3 sentence fragments (it's up to you to create these sentence fragments: beginning, middle, and end)
The quotes should be relatively coherent (no exclamation points in the middle of a sentence, for example)
Select the number of quotes generated (between 1 and 5)
Choose between 2 types of quote generators (accordingly, you'll need two different sets of sentences)
Once the quotes are generated, have the program generate new quotes or quit the program.
